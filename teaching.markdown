### Teaching

## EECS 126: Probability and Random Processes
I will be a TA for EECS 126 in Fall 2020, and in Spring 2020 I designed the Kalman Filtering lab assignment, walking students through the implementation and applications of the Kalman filter. (picture of that)

My current teaching page is [here](eecs126.html).

## Math 53: Multivariable Calculus
I was a Math 53 Study Group Facilitator at the UC Berkeley Student Learning Center in Spring 2020. I designed worksheets for and taught a twice-weekly problem solving study group section, as well as teaching midterm and final review sections.

## Tutoring
I have been working at the Student Learning Center as a mathematics tutor since Spring 2018, and have also tutored for CS 61BL, Data Structures and Programming Methodology.

### Expository Papers and Course Notes

I like creating notes on content that I learn about (from my classes or otherwise) and that I’d like to understand better. This section includes a few of these.

- My super-compact cheat sheet for CS 189, Introduction to Machine Learning
- An informally-written introduction to Jordan canonical form, introduced in Math 110
- An introduction to adjoints and inner product spaces, also for Math 110
- My proof of the Central Limit Theorem, from when I was taking EECS 126
- A (hopefully intuitive) partial guide to introductory analysis, written while auditing Math 202A
- A near-direct transcription of two Physics 5A lectures, introducing special relativity
- A guide to Einstein summation notation born out of my complete confusion in the first Physics 105 lecture
- A very informally written response to a friend misunderstanding limits when we were 14

Additionally, here are my course notes from many of the classes I’ve taken at Berkeley!

Math: Calculus II, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, Introduction to Abstract Algebra, Introduction to Analysis, Linear Algebra II
Physics: Introductory Thermo/Quantum, Analytic Mechanics, Electromagnetism and Optics (partial), Quantum Mechanics I, Quantum Mechanics II (partial)
EECS: Signals and Systems, Feedback Control Systems, Optical Engineering

(I have not included my EECS 126 course notes as I hope to instead use them to contribute to the class’s official notes.)
