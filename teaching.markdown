### Teaching

## EECS 126: Probability and Random Processes
I will be a TA for EECS 126 in Fall 2020, and in Spring 2020 I designed the Kalman Filtering lab assignment, walking students through the implementation and applications of the Kalman filter. (picture of that)

My current teaching page is [here](eecs126.html).

## Math 53: Multivariable Calculus
I was a Math 53 Study Group Facilitator at the UC Berkeley Student Learning Center in Spring 2020. I designed worksheets for and taught a twice-weekly problem solving study group section, as well as teaching midterm and final review sections.

## Tutoring
I have been working at the Student Learning Center as a mathematics tutor since Spring 2018, and have also tutored for CS 61BL, Data Structures and Programming Methodology.

### Expository Papers and Course Notes

I like creating notes on content that I learn about (from my classes or otherwise) and that I’d like to understand better. This section includes a few of these.

- [My super-compact cheat sheet for CS 189, Introduction to Machine Learning](expository/CS189_Cheat_Sheet_Master.pdf)
- [An informally-written introduction to Jordan canonical form, introduced in Math 110](expository/jordan_intuitive.pdf)
- [An introduction to adjoints and inner product spaces, also for Math 110](expository/adjoints_ips.pdf)
- [My proof of the Central Limit Theorem, from when I was taking EECS 126](expository/clt.pdf)
- [A (hopefully intuitive) partial guide to introductory analysis, written while auditing Math 202A](expository/analysis.pdf)
- [A near-direct transcription of two Physics 5A lectures, introducing special relativity](expository/Relativity.pdf)
- [A guide to Einstein summation notation, due to my complete confusion in the first Physics 105 lecture](expository/einstein.pdf)

Here are my course notes from many of the classes I’ve taken at Berkeley!
