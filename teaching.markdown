## EECS 126: Probability and Random Processes
I am a TA for EECS 126 in Fall 2020, and in Spring 2020 I designed the Kalman Filtering lab assignment, walking students through the implementation and applications of the Kalman filter. (picture of that)

My current teaching page is [here](eecs126.html).

## Math 53: Multivariable Calculus
I was a Math 53 Study Group Facilitator at the UC Berkeley Student Learning Center in Spring 2020. I designed worksheets for and taught a twice-weekly problem solving study group section, as well as teaching midterm and final review sections.

## Tutoring
