## Tip-Tilt Control
I worked with Dr. Rebecca Jensen-Clem on an improved algorithm to control the tip and tilt modes of adaptive optics telescope systems. I discussed the work at the Center for Adaptive Optics Fall Retreat, 2019, and am currently working on testing the algorithm on an AO testbench.

## Pyramid Wavefront Sensor
I worked with Dr. Rebecca Jensen-Clem on creating a simulation of the pyramid wavefront sensor at Keck II, towards demonstrating that predictive wavefront control would create the expected reduction in wavefront residuals. I presented the work at the UC Berkeley Astronomy Poster Summer Intern Symposium in 2018.

## FFAST and SPRIGHT
I worked with Orhan Ocal and Prof. Kannan Ramchandran on the FFAST and SPRIGHT algorithms to compute sample- and time-efficient DFTs and Walsh-Hadamard transforms, to make algorithm improvements based on coding theory, investigate the effect of hyperparameters, and make a Python implementation of the algorithms for ease of use.

## Occurrence Rates
I am currently investigating exoplanet occurrence rate models with Prof. Courtney Dressing, to improve upon estimates of the architecture and frequency of planetary systems around other stars using forward modeling based on data from NASAâ€™s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.
