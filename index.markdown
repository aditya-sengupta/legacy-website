Hi! I'm a rising senior at UC Berkeley, double-majoring in Engineering Physics and Engineering Mathematics and Statistics. I'm currently working with Prof. Courtney Dressing on exoplanet occurrence rates; previously, I worked with (Dr./Professor) Rebecca Jensen-Clem on control systems and sensor simulations for telescope adaptive optics systems. In my free time, I enjoy biking and always having a relevant [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) for every situation.

For my current EECS 126 teaching resources, look [here](eecs126.html).
