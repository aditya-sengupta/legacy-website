Hi! I'm Aditya, an astronomer interested in all the mathematical, computational, and engineering problems we solve so we can learn about space! This October, I'll be joining the Part III MASt in Applied Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, as a postgraduate student in Girton College. After that, I plan to pursue a PhD in Astronomy. My primary interests are in astronomical instrumentation, photometry for exoplanet detection and characterization, and statistical methods for astronomical inference problems.

I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, where I double-majored in Engineering Physics and Engineering Mathematics and Statistics. I've worked with Prof. Courtney Dressing on exoplanet occurrence rates and point-spread-function photometry, and with Prof. Rebecca Jensen-Clem at UC Santa Cruz on control systems and sensor simulations for telescope adaptive optics systems. 

I enjoy teaching and creating educational resources: check out the Expository Papers tab for some of what I've made!

In my free time, I enjoy biking and always having a relevant [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) for every situation.
