Hi! I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley, double-majoring in Engineering Physics and Engineering Mathematics and Statistics. I'm currently working with Prof. Courtney Dressing on exoplanet occurrence rates; previously, I worked with Dr. Rebecca Jensen-Clem (now Asst. Professor, UC Santa Cruz) on control systems and sensor simulations for telescope adaptive optics systems. In my free time, I enjoy biking and always having a relevant [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) for every situation.

For my current EECS 126 teaching resources, look [here](eecs126.html).
