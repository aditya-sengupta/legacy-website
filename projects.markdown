## ULAB Physics and Astronomy: Curriculum
I am the 2020-21 curriculum chair for the Physics and Astronomy Division of Undergraduate Lab at Berkeley (ULAB), an organization that introduces students to techniques and skills used in physics research. I am writing and supervising the creation of modules on introductory programming for science, Git, research literacy, LaTeX, and academic communication.

## ULAB Physics and Astronomy: Mentorship
In 2019-20, I was a mentor for ULab, advising a group of five students on a project we named ABRA, for Accessible Balloon RAdiometer. We aimed to detect the cosmic microwave background and to fit its spectrum to that of a blackbody, using off-the-shelf electrical components and custom PCBs. Progress was unfortunately halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Space Technologies and Rocketry
I helped establish the Simulations subteam for STAR, UC Berkeley’s high powered rocketry team, and was its first deputy lead. I identified simulation needs across the five other technical subteams, established the workflow for integrating simulations (in Solidworks, ANSYS, and first-principles code) into the team’s design cycle, and led workshops on running simulations and created the associated documentation.

## Custom LaTeX
I use LaTeX for all my course notes and homework assignments, and I’ve packaged my custom environments and style so they can be easily imported into a new TeX file.
